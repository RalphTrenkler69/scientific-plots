.TH SURFPLT 1 "March 2022"
.SH NAME
surfplt \- 3D surface plot with OpenGL of a matrix with real elements
.SY surfplt
.OP \-a alpha
.OP \-c height
.OP \-h
.OP \-m "angle sleep"
.OP \-w
.RI [ file ]
.YS
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I surfplt(1)
program draws a three dimensional surface from the given matrix data
using OpenGL with a wireframe or a rendered solid surface.
The input data is read from standard input or from the specified file
in ASCII format.
The input file structure is quite simple.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be given.
.TP
.BI \-a " alpha"
Enable alpha blending.
That means that the surface is translucent with an alpha value between 0.0
and 1.0.
.TP
.BI \-c " height"
Set the vertical camera position.
The default value is 0.7.
.TP
.BI \-h
Print help text and exit.
.TP
.BI \-m " angle sleep"
Rotate the cube in steps of
.I angle
in degrees with sleep time
.I sleep
in milliseconds.
.TP
.B \-w
Draw surface with a wireframe and do not render.
.SH INPUT FILE FORMAT
The input file is read from standard input or from the specified file.
First, you can include the axes labels.

.RS
.RI xlabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RS
.RI ylabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RS
.RI zlabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RS
.RI box " x y z"
.RE

This decribes the length of the sides of the three dimensional box in
which the plotting is done.
The default values are 1.0 1.0 1.0.
The next expression is:

.RS
.RI data " nx ny"
.I "z-value ..."
.RE

This is the matrix with z-values.
There have to be
.I nx
*
.I ny
z-values following the data statement.
.I nx
is the number of indices in x-direction and
.I ny
the number of indices in y-direction.
The x-index varies faster than the y-index in this sequence of z-values.
