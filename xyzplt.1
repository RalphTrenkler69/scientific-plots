.TH XYZPLT 1 "May 2022"
.SH NAME
xyzplt \- 3D lines and points plot with OpenGL
.SY xyzplt
.OP \-c height
.OP \-h
.OP \-m "angle sleep"
.OP \-s sleep
.OP \-a "alpha"
.OP \-f

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xyzplt(1)
program plots lines and points with different colors in 3D using OpenGL.
The plots can be animated.
The input file structure is quite simple.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be given.
.TP
.BI \-c " height"
Set the vertical camera position.
The default value is 0.7.
.TP
.BI \-h
Print help text and exit.
.TP
.BI \-m " angle sleep"
Rotate the cube in steps of
.I angle
in degrees with sleep time
.I sleep
in milliseconds.
.TP
.BI \-s " sleep"
Set time steps for animation to
.I sleep.
.TP
.BI \-a " alpha"
Set global
.I alpha
value for blending.
This value must be between 0.0 and 1.0.
.TP
.BI \-f
Read from unformatted fortran binary file.
.SH INPUT FILE FORMAT
The input data is read from standard input or the given file.
The head of the file can contain comment lines, which start with
an '#' character.

First, you can include the axes labels.
The labels are optional and the default is "x", "y" and "z".

.RS
.RI xlabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RS
.RI ylabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RS
.RI zlabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RS
.RI box " x y z"
.RE

This decribes the length of the sides of the three dimensional box in
which the plotting is done.
The default values are 1.0 1.0 1.0.
The next expression is:

.RS
.RI scale " xmin xmax ymin ymax zmin zmax"
.RE

This are the coordinate ranges for the cube in which the lines and points
are drawn.
The default is 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0.

.RS
.RI animate " nt"
.RE

This optional statement tells
.I xyzplt(1)
to read in
.I nt
.B data
blocks, one for each time step.
If this statement is not given, no animation is done.

.RS
.RI data " m"
.RE

This directive gives the number of
.B line
and
.B points
statements.

.RS
.RI line " red green blue n"
.I vertex-x vertex-y vertex-z "..."
.RE

This statement plots a line in the RGB colors
.I red green blue
with
.I n
vertices.

.RS
.RI points " red green blue n"
.I vertex-x vertex-y vertex-z "..."
.RE

This statement plots
.I n
points in the RGB colors
.I red green blue.

.RS
.RI line_a " red green blue alpha n"
.I vertex-x vertex-y vertex-z "..."
.RE

This statement plots a line in the RGB colors
.I red green blue
with alpha blending
.I alpha
and
.I n
vertices.
.I Alpha 
must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0.
.RS
.RI points_a " red green blue alpha n"
.I vertex-x vertex-y vertex-z "..."
.RE

This statement plots points in the RGB colors
.I red green blue
with alpha blending
.I alpha
and
.I n
points.
.I Alpha 
must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0.
