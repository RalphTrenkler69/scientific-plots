.TH XYPLT 1 "April 2022"
.SH NAME
xyplt \- 2D lines and points plot with OpenGL
.SY xyplt
.OP \-s sleep
.RI [ file ]
.YS
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xyplt(1)
program plots and animates lines and points with different colors in
2D using OpenGL.
The input file structure is quite simple.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be given.
.TP
.BI \-s " sleep"
Set the sleep time between time steps in the animation.
The sleep time is given in milliseconds.
.SH INPUT FILE FORMAT
The input data is read from standard input or from the given file.
The head of the file can contain comment lines, which start with an '#'
character.

First, you can include the axes labels.
The labels are optional and the default is "x" and "y".

.RS
.RI xlabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RS
.RI ylabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RS
.RI box " x y"
.RE

This decribes the length of the sides of the three dimensional box in
which the plotting is done.
The default values are 1.0 1.0.
The next expression is:

.RS
.RI scale " xmin xmax ymin ymax"
.RE

This are the coordinate ranges for the cube in which the lines and points
are drawn.
The default is 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0.

.RS
.RI animate " nt"
.RE

The
.B animate
statement tells
.I xyplt(1)
to read in
.I nt
data blocks, one for each time step.
If this statement is not given, no animation is done.

.RS
.RI data " n"
.RE

This directive gives the number of
.B line
and
.B points
statements.

.RS
.RI line " red green blue n"
.I vertex-x vertex-y "..."
.RE

This statement plots a line in the RGB colors
.I red green blue
with
.I n
vertices.

.RS
.RI points " red green blue n"
.I vertex-x vertex-y "..."
.RE

This statement plots
.I n
points in the RGB colors
.I red green blue.
