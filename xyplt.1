.SH NAME
xyplt \- 2D lines and points plot with OpenGL
.SY xyplt
.RI [ file ]
.YS
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xyplt(1)
program plots lines and points with different colors in 2D using OpenGL.
The input file structure is quite simple.
.SH OPTIONS
This program has no options.
.SH INPUT FILE FORMAT
The input data is read from standard input or from the given file.
First, you can include the axes labels.
The labels are optional and the default is "x" and "y".

.RS
.RI xlabel " ""label"""
.RE

.RI box " x y"
.RE

This decribes the length of the sides of the three dimensional box in
which the plotting is done.
The default values are 1.0 1.0.
The next expression is:

.RS
.RI scale " xmin xmax ymin ymax"
.RE

This are the coordinate ranges for the cube in which the lines and points
are drawn.
The default is 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 

.RS
.RI data " n"
.RE

This directive gives the number of
.B line
and
.B points
statements.

.RS
.RI line " red green blue n"
.I vertex-x vertex-y "..."
.RE

This statement plots a line in the RGB colors
.I red green blue
with
.I n
vertices.

.RS
.RI points " red green blue n"
.I vertex-x vertex-y "..."
